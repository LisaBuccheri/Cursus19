This project involved setting up our first server according to precise rules.
The aim of this project was to introduce us to the world of virtualization. We had to create our first machine following strict rules and using VirtualBox. Following this project, we would be able to install our own operating system following strict rules. 
For me, this was necessary, as I didn't have a Mac at home, so I had to create a virtual machine running linux to be able to work from home. I still use it today.

There's just a signature.txt file containing the signature of our machine's virtual disk. And a script called monitoring.sh. The latter was developed in bash. As soon as our server is launched, the script writes information to all terminals every 10 minutes. At no time should the slightest error be visible.
